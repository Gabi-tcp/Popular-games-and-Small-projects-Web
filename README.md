   While you can attack, the enemy can have guards that will protect him from getting damage:</br>

   When this happens you can select one of the guards to attack it. If you target something that is not a "Guard" the game will alert you, and say that is not a guard.</br>
***Note: At this point the cards have 0 cost because the core of the game bust be finished first.***
